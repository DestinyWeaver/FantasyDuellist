social media arena combat game

This is the first step of a larger project. I'm making a MMORPG with roguelike elements that also functions as a tabletop RPG. The final stage will include crowd-sourced GMing. First we have to get the combat right.

I'm the designer and I hopefully will not be coding. I studied computation and programming languages in college but it's been a long time since I used those skills, and they were never very good. This is my life's work though so I will code if I have to!

My name is Julien.

My initial vision is that the game will be text-based. One or more characters will be made and challenges can be issued. Generally, 1 turn will be taken at a time. A character can be in multiple duels at once, so continued play can be accomplished by switching duels or switching characters.

The idea is that the game will be quick to play anytime a few minutes are available. It will also be strategic. Play will be simple decision-making by clicking buttons.

Information is on the wiki. All help is appreciated. This project will be free forever.
