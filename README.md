There are no stats, only skills.

All actions are contests of skills.

Each side rolls 2d6. The side with the higher level gets annihilator dice. Each annihilator die may remove 1 opposing die of equal or lower number. You get 1 annihilator die per level of advantage.

The game will be free forever.
