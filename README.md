# FantasyDuellist

Choose from 1 of 12 origins. Then you have a character that can duel in an arena. Simple top-down graphical display. Decisions are made by clicking buttons. Simultaneous turns.

Eventually I am making a much larger fantasy adventure game. The primary motivation is to appeal to women, because I think that's missing today. Characters will have emotional lives and emotional interaction, with game effects. Teamwork and cooperation will be featured.

First we have to get the combat right. I haven't started coding yet but don't let that stop you. This game is fantastic. See the wiki for details.

Play will occur a turn at a time. Log in, click a button, you're done. A character can be in as many duels as desired, and a player can have as many characters as desired.
